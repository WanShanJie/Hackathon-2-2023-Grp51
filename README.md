## How object-oriented concepts were used to develop the game   
1. Classes:   
The code defines several classes, such as Hero, Monster, Game, Move, ListNode, and LinkedList. Each class encapsulates related data and behavior into objects. For example, the Hero class represents a player character in the game and contains attributes like name, health, and methods like setHero(), addExp()

2. Objects:   
Objects are instances of classes that hold data and have associated behaviors. In the code, objects are created from the defined classes. For example, Hero hero; creates an instance of the Hero class named hero. Objects are used to represent game entities like heroes, monsters, moves, etc., and to perform actions or access attributes specific to those entities.

3. Encapsulation:   
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data, into a single unit, hiding both data members and data functions or methods associated with an instantiated class or object. The code encapsulates various data such as name, health, attack, mana, exp,and so on. These data members are declared as private, meaning they are only accessible within the Hero class itself and prevent direct access to these members from outside the class, ensuring data integrity and encapsulation of internal state. Access to these private members is provided through public methods like getName(), getHealth(), etc. These methods serve as the interface for retrieving the values of these attributes, maintaining encapsulation and abstraction. The encapsulated data is accessible to the external world only through these controlled interfaces, enabling better control over the data and preventing unintended modifications. 

4. Abstraction:   
Abstraction involves representing essential features and hiding unnecessary details. The code provides a simplified interface for users to interact with the game, reducing complexity and making it easier to understand and use. This abstraction allows the player to focus on the essential gameplay aspects and enhances the overall user experience. For example, the essential features like newGame(), adventure(), loadGame() are exposed through simple, user-friendly methods. Unneccessary details such as the complex details of how the game mechanics work, such as calculating experience points, managing move lists, handling battles, and so on, are hidden from the user. The user interacts with the game through the high-level methods without needing to know the intricate workings behind the scenes.

5. Templates:   
Templates allow writing the code that can work with different data types. The LinkedList class is a template class that can be used with different types. It provides generic linked list functionality that can be utilized for different types of data, such as moves in the game. Templates help in code reuse and flexibility.

## How linked lists/stacks/queues play a role in the game   
The LinkedList class is utilized to create a list of Move objects in the Hero class. The moveList object represents the moves that the Hero can learn and use during the game. The LinkedList allows for dynamic insertion, deletion, and traversal of moves. It provides methods such as insertNode(), deleteNode(), searchNode(), and displayList() to manage the moves.

1. 'ListNode' class represents a single node in the linked list. It contains two members: value, which stores the actual data, and 'next', which is a pointer to the next node in the list.
2. The 'LinkedList' class represents the linked list itself. It has a private member 'head', which is a pointer to the first node in the list, and an integer 'num' to keep track of the number of nodes in the list.
- appendNode:   
  The appendNode member function accept
- insertNode
- deleteNode
- searchNode
- displayList
