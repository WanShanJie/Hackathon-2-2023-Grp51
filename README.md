## How object-oriented concepts were used to develop your game

## How linked lists/stacks/queues play a role in your game   
In this game

## Screenshots of game   
In the provided code, several object-oriented concepts are used while developing the game. Here are the main concepts used:

Classes: The code defines classes such as Hero, Monster, Game, Move, ListNode, and LinkedList. Classes allow the encapsulation of data and behavior into objects, providing a blueprint for creating instances of those objects.

Objects: Instances of classes are created throughout the code. For example, game is an object of the Game class, hero is an object of the Hero class, and monster is an object of the Monster class. Objects represent specific instances of a class and have their own state and behavior.

Encapsulation: The classes encapsulate data (attributes) and methods (behavior) within a single unit. For example, the Hero class encapsulates attributes like name, health, attack, etc., and methods like setHero(), getHealth(), addExp(), etc. Encapsulation helps in organizing and managing the code by keeping related data and behavior together.

Inheritance: Inheritance is used when one class inherits properties and methods from another class. Although the provided code doesn't explicitly show inheritance, it is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. Inheritance allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where derived classes inherit the attributes and methods of their base classes, promoting code reuse and establishing an "is-a" relationship.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It allows methods of different classes to have the same name but behave differently based on the object that calls them. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility and extensibility. While the provided code doesn't explicitly demonstrate polymorphism, it is a concept that can be leveraged in object-oriented programming.

Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units. Classes and objects in the code represent abstractions by encapsulating relevant data and behavior, hiding unnecessary details, and exposing only the essential features and functionalities.

Templates: The code includes a template for the ListNode and LinkedList classes. Templates in C++ allow the creation of generic classes and functions that can work with different data types. The template allows the LinkedList class to work with different types of objects, providing flexibility and code reusability.

These are some of the key object-oriented concepts utilized in the code provided. They contribute to the overall structure, organization, and modularity of the game development process, enabling efficient and maintainable code.
